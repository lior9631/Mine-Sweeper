# Minesweeper game
Game of Minesweeper with special features.<br>
This is one of the first projects that I created using HTML, Javascript and CSS.

## Game Rules
The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed.<br>
To win, you need to open all the cells. The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it.<br>
Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines.<br>
Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag using the right mouse button.
